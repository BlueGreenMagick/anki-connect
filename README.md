# Headless Anki Connect

This project lets you use Anki-connect with [Headless Anki](https://github.com/blueGreenMagick/headless-anki).
Obviously, any actions related to gui won't work. This program will probably crash if you do that.

See [Original anki-connect repo](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect) for documentation on requests and actions.
